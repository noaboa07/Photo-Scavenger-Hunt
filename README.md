# Photo Scavenger Hunt - A Geolocation-Based Task Completion App

**Photo Scavenger Hunt** is an interactive mobile application that encourages users to complete various tasks by attaching photos as evidence of completion. Upon adding a photo, the app records the location where the photo was taken and displays it on a map. The app allows users to create and manage tasks, offering an engaging way to track progress and share experiences.

Whether you're on a scavenger hunt, completing a geocaching challenge, or just having fun with friends, this app lets you document and share your favorite moments, one task at a time.
